"I feel anxious about an upcoming presentation, but also motivated to do well."
Today I'm super happy and calm after a long walk with a friend.
I'm tired and a bit stressed from work deadlines.
"Feeling sad lately, not much energy."
I feel calm and focused; had a productive morning.
A little anxious but trying to stay positive.
Excited and motivated to start my new project!
